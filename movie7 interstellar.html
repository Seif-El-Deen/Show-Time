<h2>Storyline</h2>
<div class = story>

  <p>
In Earth's future, a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly rendering the planet uninhabitable.
Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a brilliant NASA physicist,
 is working on plans to save mankind by transporting Earth's population to a new home via a wormhole.
 But first, Brand must send former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey)
 and a team of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find out which of three planets could be mankind's new home.

    <h2>Plot summary</h2>
    <p> In the near future around the American Midwest, Cooper, an ex-science engineer and pilot, is tied to his farming land with his daughter Murph and son Tom.
      As devastating sandstorms ravage Earth's crops,
       the people of Earth realize their life here is coming to an end as food begins to run out.
        Eventually stumbling upon a N.A.S.A. base near Cooper's home,
         he is asked to go on a daring mission with a few other scientists into a wormhole because of Cooper's scientific intellect and ability to pilot aircraft unlike the other crew members.
          In order to find a new home while Earth decays, Cooper must decide to either stay,
           or risk never seeing his children again in order to save the human race by finding another habitable planet.
