In this modernized version of the Conan Doyle characters, using his detective plots,
Sherlock Holmes lives in early 21st century London and acts more cocky towards Scotland Yard's detective inspector Lestrade because he's actually less confident.
 Doctor Watson is now a fairly young veteran of the Afghan war,
less adoring and more active.
